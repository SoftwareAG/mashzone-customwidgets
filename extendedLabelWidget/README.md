Custom Label Widget
=============================

Overview
--------
The OOTB widget in MashZone NextGen allows only to set selections in other elements, but not to filter on their data. This custom widget adds this functionality.

Installation
------------
This widget provides as well base styling options that can be selected in the configuration of the widget. To get this widget working, copy/unpack both folders (assets and widgets) into "<MASHZONE_NG_ROOT>/apache-tomcat/webapps/mashzone/hub/dashboard" and restart the server.
For further infos, please refer to the MashZone NextGen documentation on how to install a custom widget.

Usage
-----
The widget is to be used as the OOTB Label Widget. In this first version, it does not react to the coloring based on thresholds (for numeric values) aggregations or formatting.
This widget has been used with MashZone NextGen v10.1. Consider it as an initial, very simple implementation that you can fork and extend to fit your needs.
